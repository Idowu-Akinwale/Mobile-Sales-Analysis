- 🧍‍♂️ Who are the typical customers by brand/model — age, gender?
- 🛒 What are the revenue and unit contributions across different sales channels and payment types?
- 🌍 Where are the highest sales/revenue generated — by country, region, or city?
- 🕒 What are the month-over-month sales trends in 2024?
- 📈 Are there demographic patterns or correlations in brand/device preferences?
